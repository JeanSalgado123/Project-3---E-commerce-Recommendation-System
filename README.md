# Project 3: Public Health Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze public health data to identify trends, risk factors, and potential disease outbreaks. The main objective is to develop data-driven insights that can inform public health policies, optimize resource allocation, and enhance preventive strategies.

## Objectives
- Analyze demographic data to understand the distribution of diseases across regions and age groups.
- Identify key risk factors associated with higher disease incidence.
- Build predictive models to forecast disease outbreaks based on historical data.
- Provide actionable insights for improving public health interventions.

## Dataset
The dataset is simulated to represent public health data across different regions. It includes features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and disease occurrence, mimicking real-world epidemiological data.

## Methods
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the distribution of age, BMI, and disease occurrence to identify patterns and correlations.
- **Modeling:** A Random Forest Classifier is used to predict disease occurrence based on demographic and lifestyle factors.
- **Evaluation:** Model performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

## Results
The analysis provides meaningful insights into disease trends, identifying several key risk factors:
- High disease incidence is observed among smokers and individuals over the age of 40.
- BMI correlates with disease risk, indicating that obesity is a significant factor.
- The predictive model achieves a good performance with an accuracy of 85% and a ROC-AUC score of 0.75.

## Key Insights
- **Smoking** and **age over 40** are major risk factors for increased disease incidence.
- **High BMI** also contributes to higher disease risk, suggesting that obesity prevention should be a public health priority.
- The predictive model can be used to allocate resources efficiently, preparing for potential disease outbreaks.

## Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations to illustrate trends and model performance:
- Age Distribution Histogram: Shows the spread of ages in the dataset.
- BMI Distribution Histogram: Highlights the distribution of BMI values.
- Bar Plot of Disease Occurrence by Smoking Status: Illustrates the impact of smoking on disease incidence.
- Confusion Matrix: Evaluates model accuracy.
- ROC Curve: Measures the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates.
